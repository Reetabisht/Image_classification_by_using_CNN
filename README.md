# Image_classification_by_using_CNN

In this Image classification  task , try to build CNN Model to classify the Dog v/s Cat Image. Kaggle Image Datast of 25000 images been used to perform this task. Some Regularization techniques like Batch Normalization , Dropout used to overcome the overfitting problem of the Model.
Last but not the least, one of the important frequently used technique called Transfer Learning with VGG16 model has also been used and got the best performing model on this dataset for classification task.
